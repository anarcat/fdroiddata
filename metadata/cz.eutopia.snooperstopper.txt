Auto Name:SnooperStopper
Summary:Android device ecryption password manager and failed unlock attempts monitor
Description:
SnooperStopper allows you to have different device encryption password than
screen unlock pattern/PIN/password. You can have strong device encryption
password (which you only need to enter once after booting your device) but
simple pattern/PIN/password for unlocking your screen.

If attacker tries to guess your simple pattern/PIN/password, he has only few
tries (default is 3) after which the device is rebooted and he needs to enter
your strong device encryption password again.
