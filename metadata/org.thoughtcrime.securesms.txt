TextLibre is a messaging app that allows you to take back your privacy while easily communicating with friends.
Using TextLibre, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create groups so that you can chat in real time with all your friends at once, and share media or attachments all with complete privacy. The server never has access to any of your communication and never stores any of your data.

* Private. TextLibre uses an advanced end to end encryption protocol that provides privacy for every message every time.
* Open Source. TextLibre is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code. TextLibre is the only private messenger that uses open source peer-reviewed cryptographic protocols to keep your messages safe.
* Group Chat. TextLibre allows you to create encrypted groups so you can have private conversations with all your friends at once. Not only are the messages encrypted, but the TextLibre server never has access to any group metadata such as the membership list, group title, or group icon.
* Fast. The TextLibre protocol is designed to operate in the most constrained environment possible. Using TextLibre, messages are instantly delivered to friends.
